Nomenclature for targeting and scheduling in SDSS-V
===================================================

* Catalogs: refers to the fundamental catalogs from which the list of
	targets is derived (e.g. Gaia, 2MASS, TESS Input Catalog, etc.).
* Targeting: refers to the process of identifying a catalog object as
	a potential target for spectroscopy. Results in a global list of
	these targets in the database. This does not guarantee a fiber is
	assigned.
* Field: refers to an RA/Dec center associated with a pointing of one
	of the telescopes.
* Tile: refers to a proposed observation of a field, including how the
	fibers are assigned to targets. 
* Configuration: refers to the conditions of an actual observation of
	a field, and the specific assignments of fibers to targets.
