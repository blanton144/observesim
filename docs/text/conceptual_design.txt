This document describes a conceptual design for the targeting and
scheduling system for SDSS-V.

Sequence of events
------------------

1. Targeting

 a. Fundamental catalogs (Gaia, 2MASS, TIC, SDSS imaging, SDSS
 spectroscopy, others) are loaded into targetdb.

 b. Fundamental catalogs are resolved into a single "catalog" table.
 All targets except targets-of-opportunity must exist in this table.
 Each entry receives a unique catalogid. The catalog stores the
 healpix pixel (nside=64, which is a bit less than 1 deg on a side)
 containing the RA/Dec.

 c. "target" is run. It receives input only from targetdb.  It fills a
 table which has: targeting bit mask, epochs, exposures per epoch, and
 cadence name. 

 d. The target table is output to disk as a set of FITS files
 organized by healpix pixel. 


2. Tiling

 a. Teams define the regions over which their targets will
 be observed. These regions will be defined in terms of healpix
 nside=64 map. There will be three pieces of information per pixel:

  * window:
	    1 indicates a region with targets and 0 indicates a region without.
  * epochs:
	    number of epochs necessary for the pixel. 
  * exposures:
	    number of exposure-epochs in the pixel total
  * cadence name:
	    name of cadence desired for the pixel

 It must be understood that not necesarily will quite all of these
 regions be covered. That depends on a global tiling solution and how
 it intersects the window of the targets. 

 Although ultimately the requirement is on the cadence and S/N of
 individual targets, in order to observe a target, you need to target
 the whole region around it, which is why these requirements come in
 at the healpix pixel level. 

 b. A set of fields are defined that cover the area with the
 appropriate density. This will almost certainly be a by-hand
 task. Each field inherits some cadence necessary, driven by the
 targets it covers.

 c. "tiling" is run. Note that the iterative sequence below is an
 attempt to cast this difficult global problem into a set of tractable
 ones. This is still R&D.

  i. The code defines a set of tiles (zero or more for each field),
     and determine which exposures of which targets are taken in each
     tile. Note that at this stage there is no cadence requirement
     imposed. This can be done with a network flow as done for the
		 plates. It establishes a starting point for the observations that
		 at least observes everything.

  ii. Given the set of tiles, tiling defines a sequence of
      observations based on the cadence criteria for each field and
      the LST opportunity of each field. How to approach this is
      unclear, but constraint programming techniques may work.

  iii. Each tile now has specific planned sequence. In this context,
       we now assign targets to the tiles applying cadence criteria. 
       Again constraint programming may work here, but how to solve
			 this is unclear.

  iv. There may be some iteration in the above steps.

  v. For each tile, we need to define some window of opportunity for
  its observation in the plan. 

3. Training the strategy:

 a. Define a global metric for assessing success.

 b. Define a strategy for selecting the next tile based on its
 observability and its window of opportunity. The strategy may allow a
 periodic rerunning of tiling based on achieved results.  The strategy
 may have tunable parameters. 

 c. Run simulations under that strategy.

 d. Iterate on the strategy parameters to achieve best results on
 global metric.

 e. Assess strategy based on individual program outcomes.

 f. Iterate on choices of (a) and (b) to best achieve outcomes of (e),
 whatever that means.

4. Survey operations

Databases
---------

* targetdb

* fpsdb

Glossary
--------

* Catalogs: refers to the fundamental catalogs from which the list of
  targets is derived (e.g. Gaia, 2MASS, TESS Input Catalog, etc.).

* Targeting: refers to the process of identifying a catalog object as
  a potential target for spectroscopy. Results in a global list of
  these targets in the database. This does not guarantee a fiber is
  assigned.

* Target: An astronomical object that has been identified in targeting
  to potentially receive a fiber.

* Field: refers to an RA/Dec center associated with a pointing of one
  of the telescopes.

* Tile: refers to a proposed observation of a field, including how the
  fibers are assigned to targets.

* Configuration: refers to the conditions of an actual observation of
  a field, and the specific assignments of fibers to targets.

Standards
---------

 * All target coordinates are given in columns names "ra", "dec",
   which are 64-bit precision and given in J2000 deg, with an "epoch"
   specified in decimal years, and with proper motions called "pmra"
   and "pmdec" in mas / year.
